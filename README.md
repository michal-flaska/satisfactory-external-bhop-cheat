# Satisfactory External "bhop" Cheat

While I was walking around in my satisfactory savefile, I noticed a funny bug in the movement. Basically, if you sprint, walk forward, and then run for a second while holding your slide button, you will slide, then wait 500 ms while holding these three buttons and then keep holding them while repeatedly pressing your jump button to go ~5x times faster.

And I thought it would be funny to automate this to go even faster. So here I am, planning to create a fully configurable C++ app that waits for you to hold the walk, forward, and sprint buttons. And it will do the rest for you :)
